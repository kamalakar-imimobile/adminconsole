**Rule Based Suppressions**: Select NO for these 4 channels. If you want to enforce rule based suppressions for a particular channel then select YES for the required channel.

This feature makes it easier for you to enforce adherence to your customersâ€™ opt-out preferences. It is useful for clients who have a large number of imicampaign users setting up a large number of Campaign Deployments. A challenge for these clients is how to reduce the possibility that their team of deployment-creators might forget to include some important contact-suppression criteria as part of Target Group definitions.

The rule based suppressions are used to suppress contacts from target groups who meet defined conditions in the rules that are part of rulesets. The rulesets can be defined in IMIcampaign. A ruleset can contain one or more rules. For example, if your target group has an attribute as "Location". You want a deployment not to be sent to specific contacts whose location is "Chester", then create a rule such as "Location equals Chester". When a deployment is created with the target group and the rule is applied, the deployment will not be sent to those contacts whose location is "Chester". 

When this option is enabled, you cannot activate a deployment without a ruleset.

**Deployment Reporting Tag Button**: Select **NO** as the default option. This option allows you to generate a custom code for deployment and is tagged to the deployment. To use this option, select **YES** and then enter a name for the button which will be displayed in IMIcampaign under What tab.
