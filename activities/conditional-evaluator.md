**Navigation**: Activities &gt; Conditional evaluator

This screen allows you to evaluate the email. It helps you identify the image tag for which source is missing. That means when an Image tag is added in the HTML code but forgot to mention the URL for the image tag. This screen will also evaluate the condition.

The syntax of the condition is as follows:

> `#if_X#  
> #elseif_X#  
> #else_X#  
> #endif_X#`
